# Unit-convertor

This project is a Unit Converter application developed using Python. It allows users to convert values across multiple measurement categories, including Length (km, m, cm, mm), Weight (kg, g, mg), and Volume (kl, litre, ml). Designed with simplicity and accuracy in mind, the application provides an intuitive interface for performing unit conversions efficiently and reliably.

The converter handles user input validation, supports bi-directional conversions within each category, and is built with modular code for ease of maintenance and future scalability. This project demonstrates a practical application of Python programming for real-world tasks and showcases clean coding practices suitable for beginners and intermediate developers.
